## Description
This is a coding quiz with some basic questions to help me further understand JS and WebAPIs.
I want to get better with vanilla JS and making this quiz has helped me greatly in achieving that.
Creating this gave me a better understanding about how vanilla JS is written as well as how to style and move components around the page using vanilla CSS.
